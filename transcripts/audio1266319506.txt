 Hello, my name is Snape Hubbard. Today I will be presenting my innovative object detection and tracking system of creating a solution designed to enhance real-time monitoring and analysis. It integrates advanced object detection and tracking technologies to provide accurate and reliable real-time object monitoring. It uses the state of the art, yellow v8 and for object detection and the CSRT algorithm for tracking. Using yellow v8 stands for you will only look once of system-pand detection classifier objects with high position. It processes each video frame to identify and level objects based on a confidence level. A CSRT tracker keeps track of any object which keeps moving from one frame to another and thus they are accurately monitored. Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and levels, providing clear visual feedback directly on the video feed. For enhanced user interaction, our system can convert detected object labels into spoken words, giving real-time audio feedback. The system is ideal for various applications including surveillance, autonomous vehicles and interactive displays. It is updated to handle real-time video feeds, makes it versatile for both security and practical use cases. Now just let me share my screen to give the demo of this. So now I am trying to track this apple using ROI indexes. These are the ROI indexes. As you can see that we can track the apple. I am recording my detection for Python code for prototyping and objects. As you can see it is detecting me as a person. It can detect this apple. It can detect this phone. It can detect this bottle.
