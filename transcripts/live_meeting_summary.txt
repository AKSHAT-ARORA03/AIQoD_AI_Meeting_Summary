If you don't have a board, you can simply just go and click and create, create a new board. As you can see, this is the simplest for tier list, that's I'm using here for this board. And you can of course, it is just however you want, once it starts with the template. Once you are in your board, we'll need to look at the URL, that's your browser address bar. Here, as you can see, the board ID is the long string of characters followed by slash the board. And before like the board name is the URL.
