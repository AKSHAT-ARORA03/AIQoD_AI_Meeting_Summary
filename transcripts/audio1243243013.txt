 As you can see after the main dead stream, I can get the data, I have realized that you can get open prizes, how high the snow falls, you and the closing frames for the seven days or eight days, then we can get the plot of the ruthenicization of our dead among the decent trends, the same simple moving, losing average of that. Then I got the prediction of the next five days for the prizes of that cow. I can show you another like APN. You can see the rise of the Apple stocks appears, it is in US dollar, it is a US based company. So you can see the graph is also based on US dollars, the same simple moving average, our 20 day average was for decreasing prices, as you can see the new ones also, the recent new that what were the recent trends about the AP stocks. So you can see when you get APN, 3% on deep sleep news, after deep sleep the APN out was like 3% Twitter. So you can see all this, you can use the voice input also, I will show another one, this team at the dot ns, what model piece of level apply and that, as you can see the moving and hooking stocks. So this is my project for EIS stock market and our 2000 prediction with multi agent system using orthodium and bi-financipate. Thank you.
