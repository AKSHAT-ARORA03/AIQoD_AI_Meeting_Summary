 If you don't have words, of course you can go and create a new one and people to it, you'll be able to do multiple stuff that I would of course do the Git or to understand it by your own, especially if you are a new or to Trello. So for Rust, we will need to go and hopefully, of course, if we don't have a board, we can just go and create first full a board and then we have a board, for example, we'll find your boards here at the bottom. And we can simply just go and click on that specific board to access the full and that board. So open your Trello board for you, for the specific board that you want to get the idea of. And as I said, if you don't have a board, you can simply just go and click and create, create a new board, that's simplest as, or you can even create more starts with the template. As you can see, this is the simplest for tier list, that's I'm using here for this board. And you can of course, it is just however you want, once it starts with the template, so you don't have to worry about that. So once you are at your board, we'll need to look at the board like you. Once you are in your board, we'll need to look at the URL, that's your browser address bar. Here, as you can see, the board ID is the long string of characters followed by slash the board. And before like the board name is the URL. So basically, the URL is this one. Of course, it's just the name.
