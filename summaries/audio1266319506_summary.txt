Spencer Hubbard presents his innovative object detection and tracking system. Uses state of the art yellow v8 and CSRT algorithm for tracking. Processes each video frame to identify and level objects based on confidence level. For enhanced user interaction, our system can convert detected object labels into spoken words. ROI indexes can be used for various applications including surveillance, autonomous vehicles and interactive displays. It is updated to handle real-time video feeds, makes it versatile for both security and practical use cases. For the demo let me share my screen to give the demo.
